module Region = Region

type 'a t
(** ['a t] is a reference to an Io_uring structure. *)

val create : ?fixed_buf_len:int -> queue_depth:int -> default:'a -> unit -> 'a t
(** [create ?fixed_buf_len ~queue_depth ~default] will return a fresh
    Io_uring structure [t].  Each [t] has associated with it a fixed region of
    memory that is used for the "fixed buffer" mode of io_uring to avoid data
    copying between userspace and the kernel. *)

val queue_depth : 'a t -> int
(** [queue_depth t] returns the total number of submission slots for the uring [t] *)

val buf : 'a t -> Iovec.Buffer.t
(** [buf t] will return the fixed internal memory buffer associated with
    uring [t]. TODO: replace with {!Region.t} instead. *)

val realloc : 'a t -> Iovec.Buffer.t -> unit
(** [realloc t buf] will replace the internal fixed buffer associated with
    uring [t] with a fresh one. TODO: specify semantics of outstanding requests. *)

val exit : 'a t -> unit
(** [exit t] will shut down the uring [t]. Any subsequent requests will fail. *)

(** {2 Queueing operations} *)

val noop : 'a t -> 'a -> bool
(** [noop t d] submits a no-op operation to uring [t]. The user data [d] will be
    returned by {!wait} or {!peek} upon completion. *)

  type t = private int

  val pollin  : t

  val of_int : int -> t
  
  val ( + ) : t -> t -> t
  (** [a + b] is the union of the sets. *)

  val mem : t -> t -> bool
  (** [mem x flags] is [true] iff [x] is a subset of [flags]. *)

val poll_add : 'a t -> Unix.file_descr -> Poll_mask.t -> 'a -> bool
(** [poll_add t fd mask d] will submit a [poll(2)] request to uring [t].
    It completes and returns [d] when an event in [mask] is ready on [fd]. *)

type offset := Optint.Int63.t

val readv : 'a t -> ?offset:offset -> Unix.file_descr -> Iovec.t -> 'a -> bool
(** [readv t ?offset fd iov d] will submit a [readv(2)] request to uring [t].
    It reads from absolute file [offset] on the [fd] file descriptor and writes
    the results into the memory pointed to by [iov].  The user data [d] will
    be returned by {!wait} or {!peek} upon completion. *)

val writev : 'a t -> ?offset:offset -> Unix.file_descr -> Iovec.t -> 'a -> bool
(** [writev t ?offset fd iov d] will submit a [writev(2)] request to uring [t].
    It writes to absolute file [offset] on the [fd] file descriptor from the
    the memory pointed to by [iov].  The user data [d] will be returned by
    {!wait} or {!peek} upon completion. *)

val read : 'a t -> ?file_offset:offset -> Unix.file_descr -> int -> int -> 'a -> bool
(** [read t ?file_offset fd off d] will submit a [read(2)] request to uring [t].
    It read from absolute [file_offset] on the [fd] file descriptor and writes
    the results into the fixed memory buffer associated with uring [t] at offset
    [off]. TODO: replace [off] with {!Region.chunk} instead?
    The user data [d] will be returned by {!wait} or {!peek} upon completion. *)

val write : 'a t -> ?file_offset:offset -> Unix.file_descr -> int -> int -> 'a -> bool
(** [write t ?file_offset fd off d] will submit a [write(2)] request to uring [t].
    It writes into absolute [file_offset] on the [fd] file descriptor from
    the fixed memory buffer associated with uring [t] at offset [off].
    TODO: replace [off] with {!Region.chunk} instead?
    The user data [d] will be returned by {!wait} or {!peek} upon completion. *)

val splice : 'a t -> src:Unix.file_descr -> dst:Unix.file_descr -> len:int -> 'a -> bool
(** [splice t ~src ~dst ~len d] will submit a request to copy [len] bytes from [src] to [dst].
    The operation returns the number of bytes transferred, or 0 for end-of-input.
    The result is [EINVAL] if the file descriptors don't support splicing. *)

val close : 'a t -> Unix.file_descr -> 'a -> bool

(** {2 Submitting operations} *)

val submit : 'a t -> int
(** [submit t] will submit all the outstanding queued requests on uring [t]
    to the kernel. Their results can subsequently be retrieved using {!wait}
    or {!peek}. *)

type 'a completion_option =
  | None
  | Some of { result: int; data: 'a } (**)
(** The type of results of calling {!wait} and {!peek}. [None] denotes that
    either there were no completions in the queue or an interrupt / timeout
    occurred. [Some] contains both the user data attached to the completed
    request and the integer syscall result. *)

val wait : ?timeout:float -> 'a t -> 'a completion_option
(** [wait ?timeout t] will block indefinitely (the default) or for [timeout]
    seconds for any outstanding events to complete on uring [t]. Events should
    have been queued via {!submit} previously to this call. *)

val peek : 'a t -> 'a completion_option
(** [peek t] looks for completed requests on the uring [t] without blocking. *)

val error_of_errno : int -> Unix.error
(** [error_of_errno e] converts the error code [abs e] to a Unix error type. *)
